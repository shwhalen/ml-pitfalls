    "# Performance Inflation on Graph-Structured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "From biology to telecommunications, many real world networks can be described by the process of preferential attachment where well-connected (high *degree*) nodes are more likely to form new edges. In terms of degrees, \"the rich get richer\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A diverse set of prediction problems in biology involve interactions between elements of a single set (e.g., proteins), or between elements of two disjoint sets (e.g. protein-ligand, drug-target, enhancer-promoter).  These sets and their interactions can be represented by a graph or network structure, with nodes representing elements of a set and edges representing their interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, edges that share nodes create non-independent examples when graphs are encoded into a tabular format for machine learning.  This notebook illustrates this encoding process and how the resulting dependent examples can inflate cross-validation performance due to information leakage.  This leakage scales with the number of edges in the graph and affects both linear and non-linear classifiers, though the latter scale more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of leakage that occurs depends on the dataset, but has impacted multiple independent areas of genomics discussed in our review.  We demonstrate the generality of this pitfall for any graph-structured dataset where non-graph-aware machine learning algorithms are applied.  The pitfall is not specific to graphs formed by preferential attachment, though the presence of high degree nodes in such networks is helpful for demonstrating leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "[NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io) is used for the creation and manipulation of graphs.  Nodes are represented by integer identifiers and edges as integer tuples containing source and destination node identifiers.  Nodes and edges may have optional *attributes* which store data as key/value pairs.  No further knowledge of NetworkX should be required to understand the following notebook.\n",

    "A common machine learning task in genomics is link (edge) prediction, where the algorithm learns properties of connected node pairs in one graph to predict links between node pairs in another. Examples include predicting novel protein interactions, or predicting chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters.  Most machine learning algorithms cannot handle graphs directly, and instead operate on a matrix of features where rows are examples and columns are features describing those examples. This is a *tabular* format, and so we refer to the tabular representation of a graph as its *tabular encoding*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a tabular encoding, each node is described by a feature vector and edges (node pairs) are thus the concatenation of two node feature vectors. To create labels for supervised learning, positive examples are node pairs with an edge in the graph, and negative examples are node pairs without edges.  This process is illustrated in a toy graph with disjoint node sets *A* and *B* that could (for example) represent proteins and ligands, drugs and targets, or enhancers and promoters.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/leakage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating a model trained on a tabular encoding of a graph using k-fold cross-validation can cause potentially severe performance inflation. This is because node pairs are dependent (violating the Independent-and-Identically-Distributed assumption of most statistical models), and k-fold cross-validation is unaware of these dependencies. In the above example, the edge *A1-B1* is in the training set, and *A1-B2* is in the test set. The model will observe the features of node *A1* during training, and so may be more likely to predict a link between *A1* and *B2* independent of *B2*'s features. In other words, the model may end up learning the degree distribution of specific nodes, rather than properties of the edge that will generalize to unobserved data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function below creates a random bipartite graph for a given set of parameters, creates a tabular encoding of that graph, and evaluates the performance of baseline (random), logistic regression, and random forest classifiers using both non-blocking and blocking cross-validation.  Importantly, nodes are assigned random length-3 feature vectors: classifiers should not have above random performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, blocking cross-validation is passed the source node of each edge so that all edges with the same source node will be either in the training set or the test set.  This will reduce leakage but not eliminate it; in practice, disjoint sets of edges that share no nodes should be identified.  For many genomics problems this is possible by holding out entire chromosomes as test sets.  However, it may not be possible to completely eliminate information leakage for more complex networks."
